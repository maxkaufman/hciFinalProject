      <h2>What Worked Well</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using Figma for prototyping allowed us to iterate quickly and be flexible in our designs.</li>
        <li>User personas and journey mapping related our design to our potential users and helped us polish features accordingly.</li>
        <li>The color-coded tagging system and simple layout looked great and received praise during our testing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Could Be Improved</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>With more resources, we could have conducted broader usability testing earlier in the design process, especially with users who speak languages other than English.</li>
        <li>Navigation clarity was a small issue and could have been prototyped with multiple styles to test visibility.</li>
        <li>Some tasks (like saving articles or recovering passwords) were missing from the initial prototype and needed to be added after user feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Meeting User Needs</h2>
      <p>The final prototype of ImmiGo delivers on its core promise. To provide immigrants with a centralized and easy to use platform to stay informed about policy changes that affect their lives. Desired features like anonymous access, simplified language, and real-time article updates directly address the needs identified in our user research.</p>

      <h2>Impact of Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
      <p>The heuristic evaluation process helped surface design issues that could have otherwise been overlooked. From improving icon clarity and visibility of system status to adding back buttons and login recovery options, the feedback directly shaped our final changes. It showed how small usability improvements can significantly improve a design.</p>
