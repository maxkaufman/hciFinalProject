        <h2>About ImmiGo</h2>
        <p><strong>ImmiGo</strong> is a web application designed to help immigrants stay informed about their legal rights in an ever-changing political landscape.

        <h2>Project Context and Problem</h2>
        <p>Immigrants in the U.S. often face overwhelming challenges in understanding and keeping up with changes in immigration law. With frequent court rulings, policy shifts, and executive orders, it’s difficult to stay informed—especially when English is not a primary language and legal systems are unfamiliar. These uncertainties can directly impact livelihoods, residency status, and peace of mind.</p>

        <p><strong>ImmiGo</strong> is a centralized portal for up-to-date immigration policy information. The platform provides real-time updates on legal changes—such as court decisions and executive orders—and translates this information into accessible, clear formats in multiple languages. Our HCI-driven design ensures that all users, regardless of their tech or legal literacy, can understand and use the platform confidently.</p>
