        <h2>Project Context and Problem</h2>
        <p>Immigrants in the U.S. often face overwhelming challenges in understanding and keeping up with changes in immigration law. With frequent court rulings, policy shifts, and executive orders, itâ€™s difficult to stay informed. This is especially true when English is not a first language and legal systems are unfamiliar. These uncertainties can directly impact livelihoods, residency status, and peace of mind.</p>
